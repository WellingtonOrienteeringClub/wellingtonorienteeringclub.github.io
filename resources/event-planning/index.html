This page focuses on detail specific to Wellington (what types of events occur in Wellington, processes and timelines etc.)</p><h2 id=what-courses-and-how-long-should-they-be>What courses and how long should they be?</h2><h3 id=course-difficulty>Course difficulty</h3><p>The following course definitions are from the Orienteering NZ FAQ:</p><ul><li>White Course: Courses follow drawn linear features (tracks, fences, streams, distinct vegetation boundaries, etc.). Compass use is limited to map orientation only.</li><li>Yellow Course: Control sites on or near (&lt;50 m) drawn linear features (tracks, fences, streams, distinct vegetation boundaries, etc). This gives the opportunity to follow handrails or to cut across country (i.e. limited route choice). Compass use is limited rough directional navigation. Contour recognition is not required for navigation but simple contour features may be used for control sites.</li><li>Orange Course: Courses have route choice with prominent attack points near the control sites and/or catching features less than 100 m behind. Control sites may be fairly small point features and the control markers need not necessarily be visible from the attack point. Simple navigation by contours and rough compass with limited distance estimation required.</li><li>Red Course: Navigation is as difficult as possible with small contour and point features as preferred control sites (no obvious attack points, no handrails etc.). Route choice is an important element in most legs.</li></ul><h3 id=course-lengths>Course lengths</h3><p>A good way to work out an appropriate course length is to search <a href=http://obasen.orientering.se/winsplits/online/en/default.asp>Winsplits</a> and <a href=https://rg.orienteering.org.nz/gadget/rg2>Routegadget</a> for events on that map on previous years. The example below suggests a course at Mill Creek of 4.2km is very slightly short. Obviously differences in climb and vegetation on the course will mean this is only a rough guide.</p><p><img src=/img/winsplits.png alt=Winsplits></p><p>The winning time will also depend on who runs the course. You should set the course to have the given winning time based on who you would expect to run that course.</p><p>As a rough guide, you could expect :</p><ul><li>Red long: experienced M/W21 runners</li><li>Red medium: experienced M/W50</li><li>Red short: experienced M/W60+</li><li>Orange is difficult because it attracts a mix of abilities, but aim for a winning time you would expect for a 13-14 year-old who is confident with navigation using big contours and other large features. This course also tends to attract adventure racers.</li><li>Yellow: A 10 year-old who is confident navigating to large features away from paths or tracks.</li><li>For white, expect young children (5+) with their parents; winning time would be based on a 7-8 year old.</li></ul><h3 id=wellington-event-types>Wellington event types</h3><h4 id=college-sport-wellington-csw-weekend-events>College Sport Wellington (CSW) weekend events</h4><p>CSW events tend to have the following courses: Red Long, Red Medium, Red Short, Orange, Yellow, White. In some cases, such as where the map is small, it may make sense to not have a Red Long.</p><p>Generally, you want the winning time of orange and red courses to be around 45 minutes (give or take a bit).
The yellow and white courses should have a winning time of 20-30 minutes.</p><p>CSW requires us to relate a Course (red, yellow etc.) to an age class (e.g. M16). The below is an example of the Classes used in CSW and how they relate to a course:</p><div class=table-container><table><thead><tr><th>Grade</th><th>School Year</th><th>Championship</th><th>Standard</th><th>Novice</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Senior</td><td>12 & 13</td><td>Difficult (Red)</td><td>Medium (Orange)</td><td>Easy (Yellow)</td></tr><tr><td>Intermediate</td><td>10 & 11</td><td>Medium (Orange)</td><td>Easy (Yellow)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Junior</td><td>9</td><td>Easy (Yellow)</td><td>Very Easy (White)</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="columns columns-2"><div class=column><h4 id=csw-sprint>CSW Sprint</h4><p>CSW Sprint events generally have a Long course and a Short course.</p><p>The Long course should be technically challenging (Red) and aim for a winning time of 15 minutes for M18A.</p><p>The short course should be easy to moderately challenging (Yellow/Orange) and aim for a winning time of 15 minutes for M12A.</p></div><div class=column><img src=/img/csw.png alt="CSW Competitors"></div></div><h4 id=orienteer-of-the-year-oy>Orienteer of the Year (OY)</h4><p>OY courses are generally more technically challenging than a normal club event, and the Red Long winning time may be closer to an hour.
Generally, you want the winning time of other orange and red courses to be around 45 minutes (give or take a bit).</p><p>The yellow and white courses should have a winning time of 20-30 minutes.</p><p>Events tend to have the following courses: Red Long, Red Medium, Red Short, Orange, Yellow, and White.</p><div class="columns columns-2"><div class=column><img src=/img/competing.png alt=Competing></div><div class=column><h4 id=afterwork-club-events>Afterwork club events</h4><p>Low key events, such as the Spring Series (which are Wednesday evening events) tend to just have two courses, a long and a short. The long would be around a 30-minute Red, and the Short would be between a Yellow and an Orange.</p><h4 id=weekend-club-events>Weekend club events</h4><p>Weekend club events should have the following courses: Red Long, Red Medium, Red Short, Orange, Yellow, White. In some cases, such as where the map is small, it may make sense to not have a Red Long.
Generally, you want the winning time of orange and red courses to be around 45 minutes (give or take a bit).
The yellow and white courses should have a winning time of 20-30 minutes.</p><h4 id=score-events>Score events</h4><p>Score events are a little different as each control is assigned a number of points depending on its difficulty and competitors must try to get as many points as possible in the available time.
Wellington Score events are generally 60 minutes long.</p></div></div><h2 id=what-do-i-actually-do>What do I actually do?</h2><div class="columns columns-2"><div class=column><h3 id=6-3-weeks-before-the-event>6-3 weeks before the event</h3><ul><li>Roughly plan the courses on paper or on your computer;</li><li>Visit the map and check out your control sites, obvious attack points and the quality of the map from attacks point to control sites;</li><li>Check the junior courses in their entirety – the younger and less experienced people are less able to cope with a mismatch between map and ground or dangerous areas;</li></ul></div><div class=column><img src=/img/condes.jpg alt=Condes></div></div><h3 id=3-2-weeks-before-the-event>3-2 weeks before the event</h3><ul><li>Send draft courses to the controller;</li><li>Make changes as recommended by the controller;</li><li>Send event details to Event Coordinator (parking, course lengths, climb, no. controls) for ONZ website</li><li>Work with the Controller to complete the HARM (health and safety) form and provide this to the permissions officer along with a draft All Controls map.</li><li>Send the list of courses and classes to Magnus Bengtsson so he can publish the Entries page.</li></ul><h3 id=a-week-before-the-event>A week before the event</h3><ul><li>Ensure your courses are tidied up in Condes (see below) - numbers and control circles clear and not obscuring important features, control descriptions produced on the map correctly;</li><li>Send an ‘all controls’ map to the landowner liaison officer, so they can confirm the landowner has no issues with the control sites.</li><li>You can use the ONZ MapFramer to add fancy borders to your maps. <a href=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SsBh_jJPYg5MTrhoCTW0woudN-ZxgqQyKFedBIWcLTM/edit>A guide is available</a> on how to use it.</li><li>Send final maps and course XML from Condes to the equipment Officer to be printed by at the latest Wednesday before the (Sunday) event;</li><li>Work with the controller on a plan for making sure controls go in the right place;</li><li>Print out lists of the classes/courses for registration.
