From Wadestown, head to the top of Weld Street. If coming by car, approach from the west side of Wade Street. Head up from the first carpark and swing hard left to the higher carpark at the north end of Te Ahu Mairangi. 
From Northland, park along Orangi Kaupapa Road between the entrance to Stellin Memorial Park and Bedford Street. Walk up the Te Ahu Mairangi service road to the start. </p><p>Lion&rsquo;s Roar</p><p>This was a mini-rogaine run in 2017. There is a map and a question and answer sheet which you can use to decide if you are at the right place - there are no tapes or controls. However, some things may have changed since the event has run, so don&rsquo;t worry if the control item is not obvious.There is a start/finish location on the map, but you may start and finish anywhere.

The suggested start and finish is at Newtown Park. Parking and road access is from Russell Terrace in Berhampore.  
published</p><p>Amesbury map</p><p>Trelissick Trails</p><p>This is mostly a simple trail-run on a preliminary map put together as a lock-down project. Don&rsquo;t expect our usual mapping quality! This is a score-like event, and there are instructions on the map if you want to generate a score. There are two types of controls - those at the centre of circles as usual, or ones marked by a magenta line along a track. The magenta line controls should be obvious from the track (but don&rsquo;t worry if you pass them by). If you see them, try and identify exactly where on the track they are from the contour features around you.You can start and finish anywhere. If you time yourself, note the time from the first to the last control.  Controls are marked by bright orange or yellow tapes. Only a couple of controls are not immediately visible from a track, and you need go no nearer to the tape than being able to see it.

From Ngaio/Kaiwharawhara, use the entrances on Kaiwharawhara Road, Ngaio Gorge Road, Trelissick Crescent or Waikowhai Street.
From Wadestown, enter from Hanover Street.  
published</p><p>Amesbury map</p><p>Karori Park
There are 11 tapes out and around the bush behind Karori Park. Our suggested format is to time yourself visiting any 10 controls in any order, starting from any sensible point of entry from the roads around the map. Controls are marked by yellow ribbons; hopefully all will stay in place.Start your timing as you leave the roads or car park, and stop it as you get to your final control. The walk off the map is not in &ldquo;race&rdquo; time. Watch out for the very rough and frequently slippery tracks on the Park.There are 2 versions of the map in the linked PDFs. The control locations are the same in each, however the file labelled &ldquo;TRACKLESS&rdquo; has no tracks on it at all. This is probably only for those who have used Karori Park so often that you want an unusual challenge! You&rsquo;ll still be using tracks mostly (the off track vegetation can be a bit variable), but will have to use the contours to work out where your tracks are leading you, and no guarantees a track will be going where you want.
